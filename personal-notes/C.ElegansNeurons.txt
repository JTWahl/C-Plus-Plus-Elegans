NEURON NOTES:
CI-AVA - command interneuron
CI-AVB - command interneuron, "forward command", synapses to AVF
CI-AVD - command interneuron
CI-AVE - command interneuron
CI-PVC - command interneuron, "forward command" during wakefullness, major RIS activator, during lethargus is immune to inhibition and activation of RIS is stronger, must be activated with RIM to induce sleep
S-AFD - thermosensory neuron
S-PHA - used in phasmid organs for chemosensory avoidance, detecting reuplsive stimuli and coordinating avoidance by antagonizing ASH neurons in the amphid
S-PHB - funcitonality mirrors PHA
S-IL1 - labial neuron that plays some (?) roll in sensing
S-IL2 - same as IL1
S-OLL - same as IL1
S-OLQ - same as IL1
S-ASE - detect soluble attractants, like salt
S-AWA - detect volatile attractants, connect to command interneurons indirectly for a delayed attractive response
S-AWC - connections and functions mirror AWA, except is stimulated by odor removal and naturally exists in an ON state, is synapsed with AIB and AIY
S-ASH - detect volatile repellants and soluble repellants, is antagonized by phasmid repellant neurons PHA and PHB, directly connect to command interneurons for quick behavior, seems to be a major noiceptive neuron, seems to sense nematocin
S-ADL - detect volatile repellants, seems to sense nematocin
S-AWB - detect volatile repellants
S-URX - detects dissolved oxygen in body cavity fluids
S-AQR - functionality mirrors URX
S-PQR - functionality mirrors URX
S-BAG - detects CO2 levels
S-ASI - amphid neuron that plays role in dauer formation and maintenance
S-ADF - functionality mirrors ASI, except it also seems to be a major serotonergic neuron
S-ASJ - funcitonality mirrors ASI
S-ASG - functionality mirrors ASI
S-SDQ - also aids in aerotaxis
S-ALN - functionality mirrors SDQ
S-PLN - possibly invovled in aerotaxis
I-AIB - forms synapse with AWC, is OFF-sensing, salt and temperature sensing neurons also synapse to it to modulate chemotaxis
I-AIY - functionality mirrors AIB, except is ON-sensing
S-ASEL - ON-sensing salt sensing neuron
S-ASER - OFF-sensing salt sensing neuron
M-HSN - innervates at vulval muscle cells to assist in egg-laying, may be involved in providing feedback to rest of nervous system during egg-laying via interneurons in the brain that promote forward movement, direct post-synaptic output is to AVF for forward movement, hermphrodite specific, critical egg-laying cell, 
M-VC - innervates at vulval muscle cells to assist in egg-laying, may mediate egg-laying behavior regulation, possibly when signaled by HSN, by humorically signaling to brain
S-ALM - a body touch sensor that inhibits egg-laying when activated
S-PLM - functionality mirrors ALM
I-AVF - HSN directly synapses to it, in turn it directly synapses to the "forward" "command interneuron" AVB
A-vm2 - major egg-laying muscle cells, may send humoral input to brain for regulatory feedback
A?-RIS - seems to induce lethargus if activated, does so by releasing GABA and FLP-11 neuropeptide, is more easily activated if sleep has been disturbed, always depolarized by mechanical stimulation, especially during lethargus, can be inhibited or activated by RIM if the respective signal is strong or weak, strongly activated by PVC command interneurons
M-RIM - involved in reverse locomotion, can inhibit or activate RIS depending on the signal being strong or weak respectively, are less excitable during lethargus, must activate along with PVC to make RIS depolarize and sleep to occur

-32 chemosensing neurons map to the "command interneurons" - AVA, AVB, AVD, AVE, and PVC
	-AVA, AVB, AVD, AVE, PVC
-both amphids contain 11 chemosensory neurons that react to attractive stimuli, and one thermosensory neuron (AFD)
	-AFD
-phasmids contain nerve endings of PHA and PHB and are used for chemosensory avoidance
	-PHA, PHB
-labial neurons IL1, IL2, OLL, OLQ, likely play some roll in sensory responses
	-IL1, IL2, OLL, OLQ
-ASE neurons detect soluble attractants
	-ASE
-AWA and AWC neurons detect volatile attractants
	-AWA, AWC
-ASH, ADL, and AWB neurons detect volatile repellants
	-ASH, ADL, AWB
-ASH neurons also detect soluble repellants
	-ASH
-PHA and PHB (neurons in phasmid) also seem to detect repulsive stimuli and coordinate avoidance responses by antagonizing ASH snesory neurons in amphid
	-PHA, PHB
-URX, AQR, and PQR seem to be involved in aerotaxis by detecting dissolved oxygen in body cavity fluids
	-URX, AQR, PQR
-BAG neurons are involved in avoidance of CO2
	-BAG
-amphid neurons ASI, ADF, ASJ, and ASG play a role to activate dauer formation and mainenance
	-ASI, ADF, ASJ, ASG
-ASH neurons directly connect to command interneurons for quick repulsive response, whereas AWA and AWC connect via other neurons and take much longer for attractive response
	-ASH
-aerotaxis also gets minor contributions from SDQ, ALN, and/or PLN neurons
	-SDQ, ALN, PLN?
-ASH seems to be a major noiceptive neurons, ADF seems to be serotonergic
	-ASH, ADF
-presence of food seems to increase overall levels of humoric serotonin, and possibly also affects neurons as a transmitter, as well
-exogenous dopamine appears to play a roll in serotonin-dependant signal dampening
-temperature is sensed by AFD neurons
	-AFD
-the hermaphrodite has three main types of locomotion: dwelling, area-restricted search, and dispersal
-dwelling is when it doesn't move back or turn as much in presence of food, only moving slowly forward
-area-restricted search is when food is gone and the worm moves with higher turn angles, larger frequency of reversals, and a tenfold general increase in locomotion
-dispersal is when they are deprived of food for longer periods and reversal rates decrease with speed remaining high
-AWC neurons are stimulated by odor removal, and naturally exist in an on state
	-AWC
-AIB and AIY form synapses with AWC, and AIB is also off-sensing; though AIY is on-sensing
	-AIB, AIY, AWC
-salt and temperature sensing neurons also synapse to AIY and AIB, allowing salt and temperature to modulate other chemotaxis
	-AIY, AIB
-salt sensing neurons ASEL and ASER are also organised in a similar ON-OFF manner, with ASEL as on-sensing, and ASER as off-sensing
	-ASEL, ASER
-notably, C. Elegans avoids serawattins, which are biosurfactants that are used in bacterial swarming moility
-C. Elegans also learns to avoid toxic bacteria after pre-exposure, by means of seratonin neurons
-nematocin is an oxytocin-like neuropeptie that increases probability of leaving food in presence of younger C. Elegans
-the noiceptive neurons ASH and ADL seem to be responsible for sensing nematocin
	-ASH, ADL
-hermaphrodite males periodically release a cue that attracts male C. Elegans by causing them to reverse more frequently, and stop the characteristic male food-leaving behavior
-HSN and VC motor neurons innervate vulval muscle cels to facilitate in egg-laying behaviors
	-HSN, VC
-egg laying behavior is modulated by environment, causing eggs to more frequently released in favorable conditions
-timing and distancing between eggs depends on environmental conditions and homeostatic cues
-in favorable conditions, eggs are normally laid every 1-2 minutes, seperated by longer quiescent periods of about 20 minutes
-body touch sensors ALM and PLM often inhibits egg laying when activated, as do hypertonic salt solutions
	-ALM, PLM
-often before laying an egg, there is a burst of movement with an increase in velocity, and decrease in reversals (which persits during egg-laying period)
-coordination of locomotion and egg-laying seems to involve HSN motor neurons giving feedback via interneurons in the brain that promote forward movement
	-HSN
-direct post-synaptic output of HSN is to AVF, which synapses onto the "forward" "command interneuron" AVB
	-HSN, AVF, AVB
-interference with serotonin transmission seems to stop velocity bursts during egg-laying events, implying HSN also modulate interneurons controlling locomotion during egg-laying
-16 muscle cells are involved in egg-laying behavior, with the 4 vm2 cells being the most critical, as they receive significant synaptic input from neurons
	-vm2
-HSNs are hermaphrodite-specific and are critical to normal egg-laying behavior, with egg-laying defective mutants often having abnormal HSN neurons
	-HSN
-the HSNs are the major synaptic link between egg-laying mechanism and the rest of the nervous system, so likely also sends feedback to rest of nervous system
	-HSN
-despite this, the HSN doesn't seem to be involved in direct communication between head neurons and egg-laying neurons, suggesting an alternative route for regulatory feedback during egg-laying events
	-HSN
-this suggests humoral or other extrasynaptic modulation of vulval muscles and/or VCs may mediate the egg-laying behavior regulation
	-vm2, VC
-pheromone signals appear to underlie not only mating, but also diapause and aggregation, among other behaviors
-hermphrodites seem to utlize chemosensory neurons to sense males and resist copulation
-C. Elegans is also capable of a sleep-like state referred to as "lethargus", which lasts about 2.6 hours, and is characterized by less movement, and more aggressive locomotion when woken up
-"lethargus" seems to cause a decrease in voluntary movements, increased thresholds for physical arousal, a relaxed posture, and homeostatic regulation
-the sleep-active neuron RIS seems to induce lethargus, as it is most active at onset of sleep and can induce sleep if activated
	-RIS
-RIS seems to activate sleep by releasing GABA and inhibitory FLP-11 neuropeptides, similar to mammals
	-RIS
-disturbed sleep can lead to a more-easily activated RIS, also like in mammals, with sleep deprivation by mechanical stimulation causing lots of stress on C. Elegans
	-RIS
-C. Elegans can be woken by light mechanical stimulations, with repeated stimulations causing stress responses
-mechanical stimulation always appears to cause RIS depolarization, with this being particularly pronounced during lethargus
	-RIS
-this means RIS activation may be product of mechanical stimulation and homeostatic sleep-pressure from sleep deprivation
	-RIS
-RIM interneurons, involved in reverse locomotion, can act as inhibitors of RIS when they are strongly depolarized and activators of RIS when lightly depolarized
	-RIM, RIS
-PVC command interneurons, involved in forward locomotion during wakefullness, act as major RIS activators
	-PVC, RIS
-these neurons act different during lethargus, with RIMs becoming less excitable, PVCs being resistant to inhibition and increased capacity to activate RIS
	-RIM, PVC, RIS
-seperate activation of PVC and RIM neurons does not seem to be sufficient for sleep-induction, rather they must act in concert to activate RIS
	-RIM, PVC, RIS
